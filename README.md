## üöÄ Usage Guide

### Registering a New Person

1. Click **"Register Person"** on home page
2. Enter full name and employee ID
3. **Step 1**: Capture 5 manual angles
   - Click each angle button when properly positioned
   - Ensure good lighting and clear face visibility
   - All 5 angles must be completed
4. **Step 2**: Full view capture
   - Click "Start Full Capture"
   - Stand on RIGHT side of camera
   - Move slowly from RIGHT to LEFT
   - Follow the moving arrow for 15 seconds
   - System captures 45 images automatically
5. Click **"Complete Registration"**
6. System processes all 50 images and trains the recognizer

### Running Attendance Mode

1. Click **"Attendance Mode"** on home page
2. System loads all registered faces
3. Camera activates with live face recognition
4. Recognized persons are automatically marked
5. View live attendance count and recent entries
6. Click **"View Full Report"** for detailed records

### Running Evacuation Mode

1. Ensure attendance has been marked for the day
2. Click **"Evacuation Mode"** on home page
3. System counts total people from today's attendance
4. Camera monitors evacuation point with face recognition
5. Recognized persons crossing the line are counted as safe
6. Real-time display shows: Total, Safe, Missing
7. Color indicators: Green (evacuated), Red (still inside)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Camera Settings (in code)

```python
# Camera resolution
camera.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH, 1280)
camera.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT, 720)

# Face detection parameters
scaleFactor=1.3      # 1.1-1.5 (higher = fewer false positives)
minNeighbors=6       # 3-8 (higher = stricter detection)
minSize=(60, 60)     # Minimum face size in pixels
```

### Recognition Settings

```python
# LBPH Recognizer parameters
radius=1             # Radius for LBP calculation
neighbors=8          # Number of neighbors
grid_x=8             # Grid size X
grid_y=8             # Grid size Y

# Confidence threshold
confidence_threshold = 50  # Lower = stricter (0-100)

# Cooldown periods
attendance_cooldown = 30   # Seconds between re-marks
evacuation_cooldown = 30   # Seconds between evacuation counts
```

### Database Path

```python
db_path = "last_attendance_system.db"  # Change to your preferred path
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: "opencv-contrib-python not installed" error

**Solution**: 
```bash
pip uninstall opencv-python opencv-contrib-python
pip install opencv-contrib-python
```

### Issue: Camera not opening

**Solution**:
- Check camera permissions
- Try different camera indices (0, 1, 2)
- Ensure no other application is using the camera

### Issue: No faces detected during registration

**Solution**:
- Ensure good lighting conditions
- Position face clearly in frame
- Remove glasses/masks if possible
- Check if face is too close or too far

### Issue: Poor recognition accuracy

**Solution**:
- Re-register with better quality images
- Ensure consistent lighting between registration and recognition
- Adjust confidence threshold in code
- Capture all 50 images during registration

### Issue: Video feed freezing

**Solution**:
- Refresh the page
- Check CPU usage (recognition is computationally intensive)
- Reduce frame processing rate in code
